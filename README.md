# Superstore Analytics Report (Tableau)

📦 Goal: Explore the classic Superstore dataset to spot hidden profit leaks, regional patterns, and customer trends — and tell that story visually.

⚙️ Tools & Tech: Tableau, Filters

✅ What I built:
- An intuitive dashboard where users can slice data, filter by region, and answer “what if?” questions in real time
- Storytelling visuals that turn raw rows into answers anyone can see and act on
- Focus on clarity so business users (not just analysts) can explore insights

🧠*Why this matters:
A good dashboard doesn’t just visualize data — it *invites* users to explore and discover on their own.
